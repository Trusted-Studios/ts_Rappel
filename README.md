# Basic Rappel

This script was made for a mil-sim based FiveM server and the owner asked us to release it to the public. Therefore, here is yet another rappel script. However this one has just what it's need, so no trash code and no unnecessary shit.

## Features:
- whitelist a selection of vehicles from which player can rappel
- set the required height (min / max) to rappel
- set the max speed of the vehicle to rappel

## Restrictions
- The vehicle must support rappelling by default in GTA for players to rappel from it (Is there a way to a something in the vehicles.meta??)
